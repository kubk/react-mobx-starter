# react-mobx-starter

This project is a boilerplate for a quickstart development React applications.

### üéÅ What‚Äôs Inside?
- Create React App 3 + TypeScript 3.4
- [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - Simple, scalable state management.
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) - allows React components to be live reloaded without the loss of state.
- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - The most popular routing library for React.
- Prettier

The development process is exactly the same as you will do with Create React App.
