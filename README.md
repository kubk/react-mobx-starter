# react-mobx-starter

This project is a boilerplate for a quickstart development React applications. [Demo](https://react-mobx-starter-rfnnfku4b.now.sh/)

### üéÅ What‚Äôs Inside?
- Create React App 4 + TypeScript 4
- [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - Simple, scalable state management
- [mobx-log](https://github.com/kubk/mobx-log) - Logger for MobX, works only in dev mode
- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) - The most popular routing library for React
- A [tiny utility](src/store/mobx-form.ts) to control forms with MobX
- Prettier

The development process is exactly the same as you will do with Create React App.
