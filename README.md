# react-mobx-starter

This project is a boilerplate for a quickstart development React applications. What is included:
- Create React App + TypeScript
- MobX - Simple, scalable state management.
- React Hot Loader - allows React components to be live reloaded without the loss of state.
- mobx-state-router - MobX-powered router for React apps. Inspired by [the great article](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-decouple-state-and-ui-a-k-a-you-dont-need-componentwillmount-cc90b787aa37) of Michel Westrate.

The development process is exactly the same as you will do with Create React App.
