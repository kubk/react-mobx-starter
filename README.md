# react-mobx-starter

This project is a boilerplate for a quickstart development React applications. [Demo](https://kubk.github.io/react-mobx-starter)

### üéÅ What‚Äôs Inside?
- Vite + TypeScript
- [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - Simple, scalable state management
- [Automatic Mobx observer plugin](https://github.com/christianalfoni/mobx-react-observer) - So you don't have to wrap components with `observer`
- [mobx-log](https://github.com/kubk/mobx-log) - Logger & Redux Devtools integration for MobX
- A [tiny utility](src/store/mobx-form.ts) to control forms with MobX
- Prettier

The development process is exactly the same as you will do with Vite.
