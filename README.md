# react-mobx-starter

This project is a boilerplate for a quickstart development React applications.

### üéÅ What‚Äôs Inside?
- Create React App 3 + TypeScript 3.4
- [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx) - Simple, scalable state management.
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) - allows React components to be live reloaded without the loss of state.
- [mobx-state-router](https://github.com/nareshbhatia/mobx-state-router) - MobX-powered router for React apps. Inspired by [the great article](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-decouple-state-and-ui-a-k-a-you-dont-need-componentwillmount-cc90b787aa37) of Michel Westrate.
- Prettier

The development process is exactly the same as you will do with Create React App.
